# NOVUS--demo

Made in 2011.
The very simple project on BlitzMax, using only code, no visual programming.
Player have something like an aircraft with two modes of shooting: laser and simple gun. In the demo player needs to avoid or destroy scrap, flying on him.

Controls:
* WASD: move on game field;
* LMB: shoot;
* 1: gun (repeated pressing activate a stronger gun);
* 2: laser.
